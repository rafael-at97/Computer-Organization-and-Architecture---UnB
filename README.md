# Processor Organization and Architecture - First Semester of 2018

Repository created to maintain code and other stuff developed for the discipline "Organização e Arquitetura de Computadores" (Computer Organization and Architecture), that consitutes part of the curriculum to attain the degree of "Bachelor in 
Mechatronics Engineering" by the University of Brasília.

The first part of the project constitutes a code in Assembly MIPS capable of compressing and decompressing files using the LZ78 method. The second part of the project comprises the design and construction of an hypothetical processor organization using the Quartus software, capable of running a simple set of instructions using the pipeline model to dictate the data flow.
